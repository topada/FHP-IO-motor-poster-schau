##Abstract
###Our final assignment of the Input Output Course ([University of Applied Science, Potsdam](http://www.fh-potsdam.de/)) was to invent a **motor poster**. A wall installation which responds to passive human input. At this we studied various physical computing techniques, working with arduino and a variety of sensor modules.

##Concept

Inspired by [Daniel Rozins magical mirror installations](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/) I couldn't think of anything else than mirrors. At first I wanted to build a mirror costisting of multiple adjustable tiles. The tiles should always try to avert the viewers reflection right up to switching the reflected image in case more then one viewer stands infront of the installation.

Luckily I scaled down my prior demands. I received a flexiable mirror tile plate from the Interface Lab, that brought me to my final concept.

>The Look in the mirror as a rule reflects a mirrored selection of reality. The view of one's reflection is a concentrated and focused moment of affinity. In my installation **the relationship between affinity and distance** is put to the test and a familiar selection of reality is disturbed.
